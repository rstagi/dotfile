# Dotfile

## Automatic install

Run the following command to install everything:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstagi/dotfile/master/install.sh)"
```

## Agent checkpoints

Invoke `/checkpoint-30` in Claude or `$checkpoint-30` in Codex to request a status report and guidance after 30 minutes on one interactive task. Interactive timing is advisory. Loop phase attempts have a hard 30-minute cutoff and return a checkpoint to the orchestrator; other phases continue.

Loop defaults: Opus 5.5 orchestrator; GPT-6-Sol phase executor with Sonnet 5 fallback. Escalation and review use separate model chains. GPT-6-Sol requires Codex CLI 0.155.0 or newer.

New Loop plans include an estimate and confidence for each phase. The planner targets 20–25 minutes of active work per phase, leaving room for the 30-minute runner checkpoint. Retries and queue waits can take longer.

## Manual configurations

There are some packages to be configured manually.

### .zshrc extensions

The `.zshrc` file after the installation checks if a `~/.zshrc_ext` file exists and, if so, it sources it. This is useful to add some custom configurations that are not present in the main file.

### Raycast

Replace the Spotlight shortcut with Raycast:
- Remove Spotlight shortcut `CMD + space` from Keyboard Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts > Spotlight
- Set Raycast Hotkey to `CMD + space` in Raycast Settings > General

Finally, configure the browser extension to use the 1Password app instead of the web interface.
